`aquagenlib.h` by Senior at IPST Camp, [plumsirawit](https://github.com/plumsirawit) if I don't remember wrong.

LaTeX Template forwarded from my friends, ~~so I don't know where it comes from~~ from
[programming-in-th/statements](https://github.com/programming-in-th/statements/blob/master/templates/style.sty)
_Note that LaTex Template in this repositories is modified from original_

## Notes

Testcase generated from here is target directly to be compatible with
[cocoa-grader](https://github.com/Leomotors/cocoa-grader)

## To develop locally

- Install TeXLive (not sure which version, if error install earlier version)

- To compile statement with Thai Language, font [Sarabun](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Sarabun?subset=thai) is required

- nodejs 16+ is recommended
