# Stupid Problems

Problem Statements of Problems I wrote

**Fun Fact**: I have not write Vanilla JS for quite a long time (9 months to be exact) since abandoned [Website Vector Calculator](https://github.com/Leomotors/Website-Vector-Calculator)

## Monorepo

- web - Web Template

- statements - Statements in TeX

- src - Test Case generating

### dist

- dist-web (not ignored) - For GitHub Pages (Installing thicc TeXLive on GitHub Actions is not a good idea)

- problems (git-ignored) - Dist for problems

## Scripts

```
yarn build <target>
```

## Credits

LaTeX template and aquagenlib.h by Senior at IPST Camp.

## To develop locally

- Install TeXLive (not sure which version, if error install earlier version)

- To compile statement with Thai Language, font [Sarabun](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Sarabun?subset=thai) is required
